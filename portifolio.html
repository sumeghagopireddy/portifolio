            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Virat Kohli was born 5 November 1988.He is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. 
                He currently represents Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest 
                batsmen in the history of the sport.[3] He is the highest run scorer in T20I and IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the 
                male cricketer of the decade. Kohli is currently fourth-highest run-scorer in international cricket and stands second in the list of most 
                international centuries scored. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in One Day International cricket.[4][5] Kohli was 
                a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at 
                the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly 
                became a key player in the ODI team. He made his T20I debut in 2010 and later made scoring iTest debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number 
                one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament.
                 In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one
                  spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single
                   decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early
                    2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.
